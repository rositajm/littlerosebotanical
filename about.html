            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Rosie, a botanist with a passion for sharing the wonders of the plant world. My journey into botany started with a simple curiosity about how plants grow and evolved into a lifelong commitment to understanding and teaching others about them. From working in nurseries to conducting experiments, I’ve spent years cultivating my knowledge of plants and their care.
